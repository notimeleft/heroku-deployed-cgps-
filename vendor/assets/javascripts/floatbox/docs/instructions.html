<p class="section_title">Quick-start</p>
<p>
Floatbox is simple to install and use, even though it may appear at first glance to be complex due to its numerous options and capabilities.
The following three steps are all you need to get floatbox content lit up on your pages.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Install</b> &mdash;
Open the downloaded zip file and drag or copy the entire floatbox folder from that zip file to the root folder of your site,
or push the whole floatbox folder and its contents up to your hosted site.
</li>
<li><b>Include</b> &mdash;
Add the following two lines to the &lt;head&gt; section of the pages where you want to use floatbox.<br/>
<span class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/floatbox/floatbox.css"/&gt;</span><br/>
<span class="code">&lt;script src="/floatbox/floatbox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><br/>
(See "Help!!!" below if you are testing from a local file system and not from a web server.)
</li>
<li><b>Use</b> &mdash;
Create an anchor element with a class of "floatbox" and an href that points to your content. Something like:<br/>
<span class="code">&lt;a href="myPic.jpg" class="floatbox"&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's it, you're done.
But to get the most out of floatbox, avoid frustration and wasting time, and to use its more advanced features you really should read the rest of these instructions,
the <a href="options.html">options reference</a>, the programmer's <a href="api.html">API reference</a>, the <a href="license.html">license terms</a>,
and also check out the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.
These reference materials are in the docs folder of the downloaded zip file and also online on the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/">floatboxjs.com</a> site.
The online reference materials always pertain to the latest floatbox version.
</p>
<p class="p_title">"Help!!! Quick-start didn't work for me!! My content just opens on its own page in the browser, and not in a floatbox!"</p>
<p>
If you find yourself saying that, it's 99% likely that the problem lies in the path used to reference the floatbox.css and floatbox.js files.
Perhaps the floatbox folder is not really at the root of the site, but has instead been placed in a sub-folder one level up from the root.
If the floatbox folder is in a sub-folder, that sub-folder name will need to be included in the path references.
</p><p>
Whatever the particular circumstances of your test server, the paths to the floatbox files must be valid in the context of that test server.
Almost all cases of "it just does not work" result from a mismatch between the include lines for the floatbox files and their actual location on the site.
</p><p>
Special challenges arise with path names when developing on a local file system instead of a proper web server platform.
(DreamWeaver typically uses the local file system.)
The best approach on a local file system seems to be to use all relative paths, and not absolute paths.
The downside of relative paths is that references to the same resource will be different
depending on how deep in the folder structure the referring page lies.
Relative floatbox include lines might look like this:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="floatbox/floatbox.css"/&gt;
&lt;script src="floatbox/floatbox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
Notice the absence of the leading "/" character on those paths.
<p>
And of course if your page is not at the root but in a folder somewhere down the directory tree,
the references need to walk back up the tree however many levels necessary to get to the floatbox folder off the root:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../../floatbox/floatbox.css"/&gt;
&lt;script src="../../floatbox/floatbox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</div>

<div id="activation" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Activating elements</p>
<p>
Floatbox behaviour can be assigned to &lt;a&gt; and &lt;area&gt; elements.
In this section we will refer to those two element types as links.
To display the content referenced by a link's href attribute in a floatbox,
assign a class name of 'floatbox' to the link.
</p><p>
The 'floatbox' class can be assigned directly to each link in its class attribute
or can be inherited from the class attribute of a containing parent element.
Typically, the parent element might be a &lt;div&gt; for anchor elements
and might be the &lt;map&gt; element for a collection of area links,
but any element type can be used.
A link can be excluded from inheriting the floatbox class from a parent element
by assigning a class name of 'nofloatbox' to that link.<br/>
Both of the following have the same effect...
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a class="floatbox" href="pic1.jpg"&gt;Wallace&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="floatbox" href="pic2.jpg"&gt;Gromit&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="credits.php"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
<p>...and...</p>
<div class="code">&lt;div class="floatbox"&gt;
  &lt;a href="pic1.jpg"&gt;Wallace&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="pic2.jpg"&gt;Gromit&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a class="nofloatbox" href="credits.php"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
</div>
<p>
Links that inherit the floatbox class from a parent element will also inherit any floatbox options set on that parent element.
(Assigning floatbox options is covered in the 'Configuring options' section below.)
Here's the above example with the addition of inheriting a couple of option settings along with the floatbox class:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;div class="floatbox"
data-fb-options="group:1 colorTheme:silver boxRoundCorners:none" &gt;
  &lt;a href="pic1.jpg"&gt;Wallace&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="pic2.jpg"&gt;Gromit&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a class="nofloatbox" href="credits.php"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
</div>
<p>Note that a class attribute can hold more than one class name by separating the names with spaces:
<span class="code">class="myclass floatbox"</span> is perfectly legal and effective in all browsers.
</p><p>
Links with floatbox class names get floatbox display behaviour assigned to them by the Floatbox library's internal activation routines.
Activation will be automatically applied to the page elements at page load time.
Any links that get dynamically added to the page after page load time
must be explicitly activated using the javascript fb.activate() function
as described below in the section titled "Dynamically loading Floatbox content via AJAX, script or UpdatePanel".
</p><p>
In addition to the core floatbox display, the Floatbox library includes capabilities to show cycling image sets,
enhanced tooltips, context boxes, and popup thumbnails.
These additional capabilities are also enabled by assigning class names to elements.
Please see the relevant sections of these instructions for details.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="options" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Configuring options</p>
<p>
Floatbox options are used to set appearance preferences, size the floatbox, group items into sets, assign captions, etc.
There are 3 different ways to set configuration options for floatbox.
In order of precedence, options can be set from:
</p>
<ol>
<li>data-fb-options attribute settings placed directly on an anchor (link), or inherited from a containing 'floatbox'-classed element (see 'Activating elements' above).
These apply only to the item(s) they are assigned to.</li>
<li>fbOptions javascript object (associative arrays) defined on the host page.
These settings apply to all floatboxed anchors on the page.
</li>
<li>fbOptions.js file which will be automatically fetched at page load and applies to floatboxed items across the entire site.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The fbOptions data structure supports the ability to assign options based on content type and class names assigned to initiating links.
Additionally, all option-setting contexts include the ability to assign 'mobile' overrides, which will be applied to small-screen devices only
and which give the ability to customize floatbox appearance and behaviour specifically for mobile phones.
</p><p>
If you have a number of different floatboxed items on your site, it's a good idea to organize your option preferences based on the scope you want those options applied to.
For example, a specific anchor pointing to HTML content may have a 'width' option set directly on it,
while setting 'boxCornerRadius' for all image content would best be done in the type section of the floatbox/fbOptions.js file.
</p><p>
Enhanced tooltips and context boxes are really just instances of the standard floatbox.
As such, they will accept almost all the options that apply to floatboxes, and will respond to those option settings with the same results.
See the 'Enhanced tooltips' and 'Context boxes' sections below for details about setting their options.
(It's a little bit different than for standard floatboxed links.)
</p><p>
Option names are case-sensitive.
Options defined in an option string need to have any values that contain 'special' characters wrapped in a pair of back-quotes (`) or tilde (~) characters in order to parse correctly.
The special characters are the ones used as delimiters in option strings and consist of : = &amp; ; , and space.
</p><p>
For example:
<ul>
<li class="code">data-fb-options="caption:`this has spaces`"</li>
<li class="code">data-fb-options="afterBoxStart:~if ( x==y ) foo();~"</li>
<li class="code">data-fb-options="mobile:`padding:12 numIndexLinks:0`"</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Details of the various option-setting methods follow.
Don't overlook reading the <a href="options.html">options reference</a>.
You'll get the best understanding of the numerous other floatbox options from there.
(Note that option names and values are case-sensitive.)
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="anchoroptions" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Setting options directly on anchors</p>
<p>
Options for a particular anchor get set in that anchor's data-fb-options or rev attribute,
or are inherited from options set on a containing div.
(Be sure to read the "Activating elements" section of these instructions.)
</p><p>
The general syntax for setting options is:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a href="xyz" <b>data-fb-options="option1:value1 option2:value2 etc..."</b>&gt;</div>
<p>
For backward compatability (or just less typing), using the rev attribute is equivalent,
but a 'rev' attribute will not validate as compliant HTML5.
<span class="code">rev="option1:value1 option2:value2 etc..."</span>
</p><p>
When running a series of floatboxed items such as a gallery set or a slideshow,
many of the options from the clicked anchor will apply globally to all items in the set.
Some other options apply on a per item basis.
It should usually be apparent from context which options are per item.
For example, <span class="code">caption</span> and <span class="code">contentBackgroundColor</span> are per item
whereas <span class="code">boxCornerRadius</span> and <span class="code">colorTheme</span> apply to the whole set.<br/>
</p><p>
There's lots of examples of options set on anchors over at the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.
One example that some people might find useful in its own right, and that should give a good sense of how options can be used,
is the following anchor which will start a slideshow:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a href="" class="floatbox"
data-fb-options="doSlideshow:true group:myShow showThis:false
afterSlideshow:exit navType:none" &gt;
  Slideshow
&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
<p>
Here we are telling floatbox to start a slideshow, to use the gallery set that is defined with the group string 'myShow', that the current anchor should not be part of that slideshow set, images should be scaled down to fit the screen, and no navigation controls should be shown in the floatbox.
(Not all the assigned options in this example are required to get the slideshow functionality, and if you're copying this example for use on your own pages you will no doubt remove some options, maybe add some others, and set things to the way you want them to be.)
</p><p>
The option string syntax is quite flexible.
Name:value pairs can be separated by spaces, semi-colons, commas or ampersands.
The delimiter between a name and its value can be a colon or an equals sign.
Pixel values can be given with or without the 'px' suffix.<br/>
<span class="code">"colorTheme:red width:200"</span>,
<span class="code">"colorTheme:red; width:200px;"</span>,
<span class="code">"colorTheme:red, width:200"</span> and
<span class="code">"colorTheme=red&amp;width=200"</span>
are all allowed and equivalent.
</p><p>
Note that options assigned directly on anchors, or as parameters to the fb.start API function, override or replace the same options assigned by the more global methods described below.
To cancel an inherited option without setting a value for it, assign 'null' to the option.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="pageoptions" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Setting page-specific options</p>
<p>
The majority of floatbox's options are not item-specific and can be defined per page or globally rather than repeated on each anchor.
Use an <b>fbOptions</b> javascript object to assign option settings to all items on a page.
The fbOptions object uses the same structure and sections as does the fbOptions.js file, so take a look at that file to see how to build the fbOptions object.
fbOptions is defined in a &lt;script&gt; element placed in the primary page's &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; section.
(It will have no effect if placed on a framed child page, either in an active floatbox or as an iframe element on the main page.)
</p><p>
This example sets a shadow type, animation values and navigation type for all floatbox items on a single page,
and assigns a couple of overrides for small-screened mobile devices:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;script&gt;
  fbOptions = {
    global: {
      shadowType: 'halo',
      resizeTime: 0.6,
      transitionTime: 0.6,
      overlayFadeTime: 0.2,
      navType: 'both'
    },
    mobile: {
      shadowType: 'none',
      navType: 'button'
    }
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
<p>
Note the syntax: there are commas after each name:value pair except for the last one.
A comma after the last one will break IE.
<p></p>
Note that a standard Floatbox options string, such as would be used in a data-fb-options attribute, can be used in any option setting context that accepts javascript objects.
So we could write the above as:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;script&gt;
  fbOptions = {
    global: 'shadowType:halo resizeTime:0.6 transitionTime:0.6 overlayFadeTime:0.2 navType:both',
    mobile: 'shadowType:none navType:button'
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
<p>
The configurator (described below) can be used to assist in building the global section of fbOptions.
</p><p>
The per-page fbOptions object uses the same data structure as seen in the per-site fbOptions.js file.
This means you can include 'type' and 'className' sections to assign options to certain types or classes on the current page.
See the fbOptions.js file for syntax and available types.
</p><p>
When running floatbox in a hierarchy of iframed pages, the page-specific fbOptions object need to be placed on the top (base) document.
The settings will apply to content within iframes on the page provided those iframes are sourced from the same domain.
</p><p>
For compatibility with prior Floatbox versions, the old fbPageOptions, fbTypeOptions and fbClassOptions will still be picked up if the corresponding section is not found in an fbOptions definition.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="globaloptions" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Setting site-wide options</p>
<p>
Global option preferences apply to all pages on your site and are defined in the fbOptions.js file located directly in the floatbox install folder.
fbOptions.js does not have to be explicitly fetched by a &lt;script&gt; element. It will be automatically fetched by the Floatbox code.
(fbOptions.js can be manually appended to floatbox.js to elminate one network fetch is so desired.)
</p><p>
There are four sections in the fbOptions.js file which allow targetting options to subsets of content.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>global</b> section should be self-explanatory: settings here apply site-wide to all Floatboxed items (unless overridden by mobile, type, className, page or item-specific options).</li>
<li>The <b>mobile</b> section defines overrides to be assigned only to small-screens (generally, less than 8 inches diagonally).</li>
<li>The <b>type</b> section allows assigning option preferences based on content type.
See the 'type' section of fbOptions.js for a list of what content types can be used.
<li>The <b>className</b> section is similar to 'type' but assigns settings site-wide to items with a matching class name, including fbTooltip and fbContext classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike the 'global' and 'mobile' sections, the 'type' and 'className' sections are heirarchical in the sense that options are not assigned directly to these objects,
but rather assigned to sub-objects labelled with the type or class names.
Take a look at fbOptions.js to see this structure in action.
</p><p>
An option string, as might be used in a data-fb-options attribute, can be used anywhere in the fbOptions definition where a javascript object of settings is used.
See the <a href="#pageoptions">page-specific section</a> immediatley above for examples.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="mobileoptions" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Setting mobile-specific options</p>
<p>
Often, Floatbox appearance and behaviour settings that work well on larger-screened devices don't do so well on small-screened phones.
That's where 'mobile' options come into the picture. They define option overrides to be applied to devices with, generally, screens smaller than 8 inches.
(Measuring the screens from javascript is not an exact science.)
</p><p>
Mobile options are applied to small-screen devices after all the normal option settings have been gathered, parsed, and applied. They take precedence.
There can be a 'mobile' section in fbOptions.js and in an fbOptions script on the page.
A set of 'mobile' options can also appear as a 'mobile' option in other contexts, such as className option sets, data-fb-options attributes, and a couple of others.
Search for 'mobile' in an unmolested fbOptions.js file from the Floatbox distribution package and see a few examples.
That should be enough to get you going.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="configurator" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Using the Configurator to setup global and page-specific options</p>
<p>
The Floatbox package includes a Configurator page that can be used to generate the global section of fbOptions by selecting default setting overridess from a form.
For some, this can be quicker and less error-prone than manually typing in option settings directly.
</p><p>
Open <a href="../configurator.html">configurator.html</a> from the floatbox install folder with any browser.
Select option preferences on the form and click one of the buttons to generate site-wide global options or page-specific fbOptions code.
The object definition shown will be only those settings that differ from the floatbox built-in defaults.
</p><p>
The Configurator cannot write to a file system.
It presents the 'global' settings object code for you to copy and paste into the floatbox/fbOptions.js file or into script elements on individual pages.
You can of course use a combination of the configurator and editing your options directly with a text editor - whatever works.
The options set in the configurator could also be pasted into the other sections of fbOptions (mobile and individual types and classNames).
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="licensekey" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">License key</p>
<p>
The downloaded floatbox package is for evaluation, development and testing and does not have a license key bundled with it.
Without a valid license key, floatbox will periodically show a registration reminder.
You can acquire a license key from the <a href="//floatboxjs.com/register">Floatbox registration page</a>.
When you have acquired and installed a license key matched to your production site's domain, you will be legally entitled to deploy the floatbox software to that site and the registration reminders will not occur.
You do not need a license key for development or evalution work.
The floatbox package is complete and fully functional without a license key.
</p><p>
Install a license key by placing it in the floatbox/fbOptions.js file.
The location for the licenseKey in fbOptions.js looks like this:
</p>
<div class="code">global: {
  licenseKey: ""
</div>
<p>
The key goes between the quotes.<br/>
fbOptions.js can be edited directly or the <a href="#configurator">configurator</a>.html form can be used to assist.
</p><p>
The license key can also be set directly on a page in an 'fbOptions' javascript object (see the "<a href="#pageoptions">Setting page-specific options</a>" section of these instructions).
A bare-bones fbOptions definition with a licenseKey looks like this:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;script&gt;
fbOptions =  {
  global: {
    licenseKey: 'abcd1234'
  }
};
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
<p>
The configurator can help build the global section of fbOptions.
</p><p>
The license key can be tested by viewing a page that is using Floatbox and then running
<span class="code">fb.key()</span> from the browser's developer console.
</p><p>
License keys are matched to the domain name that the registered site is running under.
Checking that the key is valid on that domain is done entirely by the Floatbox code running within the visitor's browser.
There is no lookup made to a registration db anywhere and no 'phoning-home' of any kind.
</p><p>
The licenseKey field can accept multiple keys separated by a space or comma.
This can be useful when serving the Floatbox files to multiple registered sites from a central server,
publishing to multiple sites from a standardized content base,
or if two or more domain names resolve to the same web site.<br/>
For old Floatbox versions prior to 5.3.0, these same multi-site or multi-domain scenarios can be satisfied by using a multi-domain "master" key
obtained from the license key management page that is made available to purchasers of two or more registrations.
</p><p>
If you wish to test or develop offline using 'localhost', an ip address, or a local file system and avoid the distraction of the registration reminders,
feel free to use the following license key:<br/>
<span style="font-family:monospace; margin-left:25px;">ExfZEBCcExvo</span><br/>
If using this offline key, don't forget to obtain a real key for your production site before going live.
</p><p>

</p>

<div id="upgrade" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Upgrading</p>
<p>
When upgrading to a newer version of Floatbox, consider the browser cache implications for your site visitors.
It's a good idea to rename the floatbox folder and add a version or some other unique segment to it.
For example, version 6.0.1 of Floatbox could be located in a folder named /includes/floatbox_601/.
By changing the folder name at each install you can guarantee that the visitors won't run into trouble by mixing
different version files from their cache and from the site.  You will of course have to take the trouble of changing
the paths on the script and link elements that load floatbox.js and floatbox.css. 
</p><p>
If upgrading a minor version release but within the same major version family,
just drop the new files in place and move your previous fbOptions.js file into the new folder
if there's any settings (or license key) in there that you want to retain.
When upgrading to a new major version, manually edit the new fbOptions.js file with your preferred settings.
There may also be option and API changes between major versions that might require changes to the floatbox
markup on your pages.  Check the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/download">changelog</a> entry for the 1st release of the new major version
and see if any of the interface changes described there will affect you.
<p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="type" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">File &amp; content types</p>
<p>
Floatbox determines what kind of content is being requested based on the file extension from an anchor's href attribute.
Sometimes you may need to over-ride that detection and specify a content type directly.
Content type over-ride is always required when loading AJAX,
and can also be needed when you have a .php or .aspx page serving images.
</p><p>
By default, .php and .aspx urls will be loaded as iframes.
To make them load as images, set "type:image" on the anchor's data-fb-options attribute.
If you're fetching AJAX content, you need a "type:ajax" over-ride in the options.
</p><p>
Examples:
<div class="code">&lt;div class="floatbox"&gt;
  &lt;a href="getPix.php?pic=29" <b>data-fb-options="type:image"</b>&gt;Pic 29&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="contact.html" <b>data-fb-options="type:ajax"</b>&gt;Contact Form&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<div id="image" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Images: galleries and slideshows</p>
<p>
Floatbox's default behaviour for showing images is to open a single image by itself.
A gallery set can be created by assiging an identical 'group' option to two or more anchors that reference image files.
Grouping image references adds navigation to the floatbox that lets the viewer move through the grouped set using 'previous' and 'next' navigation buttons, keyboard arrow keys, and/or index links.
(Index links are described below in these instructions.)
An 'item number' display also becomes available that will show 'image x of y' in the floatbox's frame area.
See the 'Galleries' section of the Options Reference for option settings that control gallery set behaviours.
</p><p>
A gallery set can be shown as a slideshow by setting the 'doSlideshow' option to true.
This will cause the gallery set to auto-advance through the images on an interval set by the 'slideInterval' option.
See the 'Slideshows' section of the Options Reference for more options that control slideshow behaviour.
</p><p>
The easiest way to setup a gallery set is to take advantage of Floatbox's ability to propagate the 'floatbox' class and option settings from a containing div to the anchor elements in that div.
Also note that anchors used to define gallery set members do not have to have clickable content such as a thumbnail image or text. The anchors can be empty.
Here's an example:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;div class="floatbox" data-fb-options="group:1 doSlideshow:true"&gt;
  &lt;a href="image1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="thumb1.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="image2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="image3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<div id="html" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">HTML content: iFrames, AJAX, inline DIVs &amp; direct</p>
<p>
There are 4 ways to load HTML into a floatbox: as an iframe, using AJAX, using content from inline hidden DIVs, and using a direct HTML string as the content source.
Standard anchor hrefs that aren't recognized as an image or multi-media type will be loaded as iframe content by default.
</p><p>
To load an HTML snippet from a separate file using AJAX, set the anchor's href to reference the AJAX source URL and put "type:ajax" in the anchor's data-fb-options attribute.
To load content from an inline div, give that div a unique id and reference that id in the anchor's href attribute preceeded by "#" (e.g., href="#myDiv").
A string of direct HTML can be used as the source parameter to the fb.start() API function.
Direct HTML content must include at least one each of '&lt;' and '&gt;' to be recognized as HTML content.
As an example, a plain text tooltip source would need to include a wrapping element, such as <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;Eat a Peach&lt;/p&gt;</span>.
</p><p>
Floatbox's default content type is iframe content.
Load a page as an iframe in a floatbox simply by setting the anchor's href to the source path of that page.
If a URI that points to an iframe content source page includes a #hash id value, the iframe page will scroll to the element that has that id assigned when opened in a floatbox.
</p><p>
There's lots of useful options that can be assigned to floatboxed HTML content.
Please look through the <a href="options.html">options reference</a> to get an idea of what's available.
Good ones to be aware of are 'width', 'contentScroll', 'contentBackgroundColor', 'autoFit', 'showNewWindow', 'showPrint', and the '*Pos' positioning settings.
It's also worthwhile to check out the 'Let floatbox set content height' section further down in these instructions.
</p><p>
iframe:
<div class="code">&lt;a href="mypage.html" class="floatbox"
data-fb-options="width:400 height:530 contentScroll:false" &gt;
  Iframe page
&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
</p><p>
ajax:
<div class="code">&lt;a href="myajaxpage.html" class="floatbox"
data-fb-options="type:ajax width:400" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
</p><p>
inline div:
<div class="code">&lt;a href="#divID" class="floatbox"&gt;Div content&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
</p><p>
And one example of direct HTML in an API call:
<div class="code">fb.start( '&lt;span&gt;Eat a Peach&lt;/span&gt;', 'width:150 showPrint:true' );

<div id="video" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Video: HTML5 player, YouTube &amp; Vimeo</p>
<p class="p_title">HTML5 video player</p>
<p>
Floatbox includes an integrated HTML5 video player (with Flash fallback) which provides a great way to deploy and view locally served video.
To set up a locally served HTML5 video:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Place an H.264 encoded .mp4 file in a folder.</li>
<li>Optionally add a .jpeg file of the same name to be used as the video "poster" in mobile devices.</li>
<li>Create a link (&lt;a&gt; element) with an href that points to the .mp4 file and put the "floatbox" class on that link.</li>
<li>The fbOptions.js file contains a relative height setting for type:video that will set proportional sizing for 16:9 videos.
Use a different relative height setting for videos with different proportions
or add explicit "width" and "height" settings to also override the default display sizing.
Optionally set "addPlayButton" in the link's data-fb-options attribute.</li>
<li>Make sure your server is configured to serve video files using the correct mime type.
<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">
<br/># For example, in Apache's .htaccess file:
</span>
<div class="code">AddType video/mp4 .mp4
AddType video/webm .webm
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most modern browsers will play the HTML5 video.
For older browsers that cannot, the Flash-based <a href="http://flash.flowplayer.org/" target="_blank">Flowplayer</a>
will be invoked and the .mp4 video will be shown with that.
By default, Flowplayer will be loaded from the jsdelivr.net content distribution network.
You can obtain a more recent version and run it from your own server by updating the reference in floatbox/video.html,
but unless jsdelivr disappears (unlikely), there's probably no advantage in doing so.
</p><p>
There are three control parameters that can be passed to the video player through a query-string on the href's URI path.
</p>
<ul>
<li>"autoend=0" will turn off the default behaviour of closing the floatbox when the video ends.</li>
<li>"poster=/somePath/someFile.jpg" will set the poster image to be used in mobile browsers, and "poster=null" will prevent the player from looking for the default poster image.</li>
<li>"bgcolor=#112233" will override the default transparent background.</li>
</ul>
<p>example:</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a class="floatbox" href="/somePath/myVideo.mp4?autoend=0"
data-fb-options="width:777 height:444 addPlayButton:true" &gt;
  &lt;img src="/somePath/myThumb.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
<p class="p_title">YouTube &amp; Vimeo</p>
<p>
YouTube and Vimeo offer video embedding services as iframe content rather than traditional flash-based object/embed elements.
This allows delivery of a format suitable for the platform being used - e.g., flash content for desktop browsers that have the plugin,
HTML5 video for iPads/Phones and other Flash-free agents.
When showing videos from these online services, Floatbox will use the iframe content format, and thus reap the benefits of its flexibility.
Floatbox will also query the API services of these video providers and fetch information that can be used to auto-assign captions,
determine default video dimensions, and get references to thumbnails that can be auto-inserted into links to the videos.
</p><p>
A quick way to understand Floatbox's video service capabilities, and to learn how to configure and use these capabilities,
is to check out the  "Video" tab on <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">the demo page</a>.
Here are some pointers on setting up video:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Link to an online video from one of these providers using the URL that you use to view the video on their site.
For example:
<ul>
<li>YouTube: <span class="code">href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xorau81YT20"</span>
or <span class="code">href="http://youtu.be/Xorau81YT20"</span></li>
<li>Vimeo: <span class="code">href="http://vimeo.com/1211060"</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a caption is not assigned in the Floatbox options, the video title will be retrieved from the service's API and used as the caption.
For no caption, set <span class="code">caption:null</span></li>
<li>For Vimeo public videos only, if width and height are not assigned in the Floatbox options, the native video dimensions will be retrieved from the Vimeo API and used.</li>
<li>Floatbox can auto-insert a thumbnail image into your anchor elements that reference YouTube or Vimeo public videos, complete with an overlayed play button.
Use the 'addVideoThumb' and 'addPlayButton' options for this.
See the Options Reference and the demo page example.</li>
</ul>

<div id="flash" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Flash content</p>
<p>
Floatbox provides smart handling of .swf content files using the browser's installed Flash plugin.
If the plugin is not present, floatbox will display a notice (localized to the site visitor's language) with a link to the plugin download page.
</p><p>
Floatbox assigns the following parameter default values to Flash content: <b>allowFullScreen</b>=true, <b>allowScriptAccess</b>=always, <b>loop</b>=false, <b>quality</b>=autohigh, <b>scale</b>=exactfit, <b>wmode</b>=opaque.
You can over-ride these, plus '<b>base</b>', '<b>bgcolor</b>', '<b>menu</b>', '<b>play</b>' and '<b>salign</b>', by providing new values in the href url's querystring.<br/>
e.g...
<div class="code">&lt;a href="myflash.swf?wmode=direct&amp;amp;bgcolor=#ffffff&amp;amp;scale=default"
class="floatbox" data-fb-options="width:320 height:240" &gt;
  Flash: not quite dead yet
&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
</p><p>
If your flash object requires flashvars to be set, you can put these flashvars in the href url's querystring.
Flash always treats flashvars and querystring vars equivalently and it doesn't matter in which location the settings appear.
</p><p>
The object element used to show Flash content in a floatbox is assigned an id that is the filename (without extension) of the showing .swf file.
For example, the id of the "tetka.swf" example on the Floatbox demo page is "tetka".
This id can be used if script access to the object instance is required.
</p><p>

</p>

<div id="pdf" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">PDF &amp; Scribd.com</p>
<p>
PDF content is problematic.
The way Floatbox handles .pdf references is to put them up in an iframe and let the browser sort it out as best it can.
Many modern browsers will render the PDF document correctly
but some require that a PDF Reader Plugin be installed which may not be present.
The plugin might not be installed or may not function well.
Some browsers will download rather than display PDF documents, and some of these don't even prompt before downloading.
</p><p>
When direct-loading PDF, numerous parameters can be specified as a query string following a hash character on the href path.
The PDF sample on the "HTML" tab of the demo page shows the usage of parameters and opens a document that lists and describes the parameters that are available in most browsers.
</p><p>
A better alternative to direct-loading PDF documents is to either convert them to HTML or
host the documents on scribd.com and load them using the document's /embed/ path from that service.
The scribd service uses a combination of Flash and HTML5 iframe embeds to make the docs viewable in almost all browsers, including mobile devices.
See the scribd example on the "HTML" tab of the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">Floatbox demo page</a> for details on how to setup the links and to test how the scribd viewer works from different platforms.

<div id="autoheight" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Let floatbox set content height</p>
<p>
Floatbox can measure and set the dimensions for HTML content.
It's a good idea to let floatbox do this, especially for height, so that the box dimensions will look correct in different browsers.
Different browsers layout content slightly differently from each other, and the right box height in one browser can be too short or too tall in another.
</p><p>
The best approach for AJAX, same-domain iframe, inline and direct HTML is to constrain the content's width either by setting a floatbox width option or defining widths in the content's styles,
and then let Floatbox measure the height. When no height is specified for these HTML content types, the height will be measured and the floatbox size adjusted appropriately.
Note that the maxWidth option, if specified as a %, is a good way to restrict the size of the content on smallScreen devices.
</p><p>
99% of Floatbox's HTML measurements are correct, but it can fail on content with complex or particularly fluid styles.
In these rare cases, you'll jast have to fiddle with the styling or break down and give an explicit height in the options.
Cross-domain iframe content cannot be measured by script; consequently, box height cannot be automatically matched to content height for cross-domain iframe content.
Nor can video be measured, but height can be specified as a % of the width (height:xx%w) to maintain correct aspect ratio.
This is done in fbOptions.js for type:video and sets a default of widescreen 16/9 proportions.

<div id="cycler" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Cycling images and thumbnails</p>
<p>
Floatbox includes the ability to display a set of images or thumbnails that will fade, zoom and cycle through each image in succession.
This can be an effective way to show dynamically changing images, setup a slideshow link or perhaps put a dynamic header at the top of a web page.
See examples of this under the "Cyclers" tab on the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.
The sample code under those demos are a good way to get started with your own cycle set.
</p><p>
Cycler sets can show a 'Ken Burns' style zoom effect on images in between transitions.
The cycleZoom, cycleEasing and cycleInflection control this zoom effect, with "cycleZoom:0" disabling it.
See the Options Reference for more detail.
(Note: the cycleZoom effect will not be shown in IE 7 & 8.)
</p><p>
The cycleInterval and cycleFadeTime options are used to control timings.
cycleFadeTime controls how quickly the images fade in and out while cycleInterval sets the time between initiation of the fade to the next image.
The cycleInterval includes cycleFadeTime, so if for example they are both set to 3 seconds, they will constantly be fading to the next image.
</p><p>
A cycler set can be configured to pause and resume on mouse click or touch gesture,
and to optionally show a small play/pause control over the cycling images.
Set "cyclePauseOnClick:true" to enable pause and resume on click,
"cycleShowControls:false" to hide the controls,
"cycleControlsPos:__" (fill in the blanks) to place the controls at a particular location over the images,
and "cycleStartPaused:true" to begin the cycler set in the paused state at page load time.
There are also cyclePauseOnHover and cycleResumeOnHover settings which, if set to true,
will either pause or start a cycler div when the mouse is hovered over it.
</p><p>
You can use CSS to style up the play/pause control if you're not satisfied with the default look.
Assign the desired styles to ".fbCycler span.fbCyclerControl".
</p><p>
The set of images to be cycled goes inside a div with a class of "fbCycler" assigned to that div.<br/>
<span class="code">&lt;div class=&quot;fbCycler&quot; style=&quot;height:420px;&quot;&gt;</span><br/>
The 'height' style is needed only if the images in the cycler set vary in height.
In this case, setting height to the tallest image value prevents unsightly layout changes when new images are shown.
The optional 'data-fb-options' attribute can be used to assign desired option preferences.
</p><p>
The first image in the cycler set is just a normal image element and will be the only one shown if javascript is disabled:
e.g., <span class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;image1.jpg&quot;/&gt;</span><br/>
</p><p>
The other images in the fbCycler div are setup a little differently and will start off hidden by floatbox.css:<br/>
<span class="code">&lt;img data-fb-src=&quot;image2.jpg&quot;/&gt;</span><br/>
We can use the data-fb-src attribute to specify the path to the image file, instead of the normal src attribute.
This is done to speed up page loading.
If we assigned a src attribute to each of the hidden images, all the images in the set would be loaded at page start time.
The floatbox code will move the data-fb-src values into the src attribute one at a time as the images are cycled in.
If you're concerned about img elements with no src attribute failing validation,
assign a tiny image like blank.gif as the initial src value.
</p><p>
Add a few more images and close the div and the basic cycle set is finished.
</p><p>
Captions can be added to individual images in the cyler set. These captions will be centered below the image.
When the 'titleAsCaption' option is set to true, which it is by default, the caption can be specified in the img element's title attribute.
Alternatively, we can set 'altAsCaption' to true and thereby pull the captions from the img element's alt attribute.
If you don't want to use either the title or alt attribute for the captions,
a caption can be assigned by bundling both the img element and a span element that holds the caption text together inside a div. Like this:<br/>
<span class="code">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img data-fb-src=&quot;image3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span&gt;text for image3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</p><p>
The cycling images can be thumbnails within anchor elements marked up for floatbox behaviour,
giving a nicely integrated floatbox gallery that will open on  thumbnail click.
Such a set looks similar to the basic cycling image set described above but, instead of putting img elements in the containing div,
we put anchors in and assign both a 'floatbox' and 'fbCycler' class to the div.
Like this:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;div class=&quot;fbCycler floatbox&quot; style=&quot;height:100px;&quot;
data-fb-options=&quot;group:cycle1&quot; &gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;image1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;thumb1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;image2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-fb-src=&quot;thumb2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;image3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-fb-src=&quot;thumb3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  etc...
&lt;/div&gt;
</div>
<p>
Notice that all but the first thumbnail img elements are using the "data-fb-src" trick to speed load time.
</p><p>
Again, caption text can be added to the cycling thumbnails or images by using the 'title' attribute, the 'alt' attribute,
or by following the img element with a span element, as descibed above. For example:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a href=&quot;image4.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img data-fb-src=&quot;thumb4.jpg&quot; title=&quot;this is caption 4&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;image5.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img data-fb-src=&quot;thumb5.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;this is caption 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
<p>
cycleFadeTime can be set only globally or per page; different cyclers on the same page cannot use different timings.
The cycleInterval setting can be assigned globally, per page, in the fbCycler div options, or on a per-image basis giving different display times for different images in the set.
Per-image cycleIntervals are assigned in an fb-data-options or rev attribute placed on the individual divs, anchors or images inside the fbCycler div.
Here's an example with an interval of 4.5 seconds for the cycler set and a different per-image interval for one set member:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;div class=&quot;fbCycler&quot; style=&quot;height:420px;&quot;
data-fb-options=&quot;cycleInterval:4.5 altAsCaption:true&quot; &gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image99.jpg&quot; data-fb-options=&quot;cycleInterval:10&quot; alt=&quot;some dumb caption&quot;/&gt;
  etc...
&lt;/div&gt;
</div>

<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="tooltip" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Enhanced tooltips</p>
<p>
Any element on a web page can have an enhanced tooltip associated with it by assigning the element a class of "fbTooltip".
The tooltip shown on mouseover of such an element is a non-modal floatbox which can contain any content type
and can by styled with all the standard floatbox options.
</p><p>
In addition to the fbTooltip class, the host element needs to have a 'data-fb-tooltip' attribute which provides information about the tooltip to be shown.
The only mandatory entry in data-fb-tooltip is 'source', which points to the source content to be shown as the tooltip.
Tooltip source content is typical HTML and can come from any of Floatbox's supported HTML content sources:
a hidden div, an AJAX fetch, an external page loaded as an iframe, or an encoded string of HTML assigned directly to the 'source' option.
</p><p>
Tooltips will respond to most of the available Floatbox options that are described in <a href="options.html">the Options Reference</a>.
Additional options that apply only to tooltips are described in their own section in that reference as well.
The tooltip-specific options are 'placement', 'attachToHost', 'moveWithMouse', 'showOnce', and 'delay'.
</p><p>
The tooltip options can be specified per element in the data-fb-tooltip attribute,
per page by being assigned to to the 'fbTooltip' class in the className section of an fbOptions object,
or site-wide by being assigned to the 'fbTooltip' class in fbOptions.js.
</p><p>
Be nice to users of touch devices and don't put tooltips on link (&lt;a&gt;) elements.
They will never see the tooltip but instead will navigate away when tapping the link.
Combine a tooltip and a link by placing the link inside the tooltip body.
The first touch will open the tooltip revealing the link that can be followed by a second touch.
</p><p>
Here's some fbTooltip markup on a &lt;span&gt; host element:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;span class=&quot;fbTooltip&quot;
data-fb-tooltip=&quot;source:#hiddenDivID moveWithMouse:false&quot; &gt;
  Tooltip will appear when the mouse is hovered over this text.
&lt;/span&gt;
</div>
<p>
See the "Tooltips+" tab of the demo page for some live examples with markup shown.
<p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="context" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Context boxes</p>
<p>
Context boxes are similar to the enhanced tooltips except they are triggered by a left or right mouse button click.
They can form an effective replacement for a browser's built-in context menus, can consist of any HTML content, and will respond to mobile device touch gestures as well as mouse interaction.
</p><p>
Assign a context box to any element on a page by giving that element a class name of 'fbContext' and adding a 'data-fb-context' attribute that contains at least a 'source' reference.
The context box's content can come from a source of any type, but an inline hidden div is probably the most common and convenient.<br/>
For example:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;img class="fbContext" data-fb-context="source:#context1" src="pic1.jpg"/&gt;
</div>
<span style="font-size: .85em;">(It doesn't have to be an img element. Any element type can host a context box.)</span>
<p>
Context boxes will accept and respond to most standard floatbox options (including 'contentClickCloses').
Assign option preferences in the 'data-fb-context' attribute, or in the usual per-page or global manner.
Options can be assigned to the 'fbContext' class in the className section of fbOptions.js
or in the corresponding section of an fbOptions definition on the host page.
</p><p>
The only option that is specific to context boxes is 'contextMouseButton', which can be set to 'both' (the default), 'left', or 'right' and controls which buttons activate the context box.
Please be aware that right-clicking is problematic in some browsers and it will not work everywhere.
All versions of Opera prior to 10.5 will show the browser's native context menu over top of our context box, ignoring the instructions sent to it to not display that menu.
Other browsers have an advanced configuration setting that individual users can set to either make their browser always show the context menu, just like old Opera, or to ignore right-click mouse actions altogether.
Most browsers will respond correctly to a right-click on an fbContext element, but it is recommended that 'contextMouseButton' not be set to 'right' unless you have full control over the environment your pages will operate in.
Leave left-clicking available for people who need it.
</p><p>
Examples are on the "Tooltips+" tab of the demo page.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="popup" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Popup thumbnails</p>
<p>
"Popup" thumbnails or images can be attached to an anchor element and will start off invisible, but show on mouse-over or a touch on the anchor content.
There are 5 classes that can be assigned to an anchor to give its contained img element popup behaviour:
"fbPopup", "fbPopdown", "fbPopleft", "fbPopright" and "fbPopcenter".
These classes determine where, in relation to the host anchor, the popped up image will appear.
</p><p>
An 'fbPop*' anchor can also be a standard floatboxed anchor if both class names are assigned.
E.g., <span class="code">class="fbPopright floatbox"</span>.
The hidden thumbnail will appear on mouseover and a floatbox will start from that thumbnail when it, or the host anchor, is clicked.
Without a class of "floatbox" assigned, the anchor will navigate to its href as normal when clicked.
To have a popup anchor that neither opens a floatbox nor navigates when clicked, leave the 'floatbox' class off and set the href to
<span class="code">href="javascript:void 0"</span>.
</p><p>
If there are two images in an 'fbPop*' anchor, the first one will get popup behaviour assigned while the second one will always show as normal.
Having two thumbnail images can be combined with the 'fbPopcenter' assignment to create a nice expanding thumbnail effect.
Make the first image in the anchor a larger version of the second image.
On mouseover, the thumbnail will appear to expand to the larger size.
</p><p>
As you might guess, there's samples to be found in the 'Tooltip+' section of the demo page.

</p>

<div id="captions" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Captions</p>
<p>
The standard way to show a caption in the floatbox frame area is to set the 'caption' option in an anchor's data-fb-options (or rev) attribute.
When doing this, the caption text usually needs to be wrapped in backquotes (`) so that the options string will be parsed correctly.
</p><p>
You can show two captions on the same item.
To do so, assign the second caption to the 'caption2' option in the same manner as the first caption.
</p><p>
If the 'titleAsCaption' option is set to true (which it is by default) and a caption is not defined,
the caption will be taken from the host anchor's title attribute or that of a thumbnail img element in the anchor.
Captions can also be taken from the alt attribute of img elements by setting 'altAsCaption' to true.
Be aware that browsers display an anchor's title as a tooltip when the user mouses over the anchor.
If you don't want this browser tooltip to occur, set your caption using the caption option (or the alt attribute) rather than placing it in the title attribute.
</p><p>
Here's two examples:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;div class="floatbox"&gt;
  &lt;a href="boogers1.jpg"
  data-fb-options="caption:`This is the first caption`
  caption2:`And this is the second caption`" &gt;
    boogers!
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="boogers2.jpg"
  title="This is both a tooltip and a caption" &gt;
    more boogers!
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</div>
<p>
Floatbox captions can be built from, or contain, HTML elements.
There's two ways to get HTML into your captions.
The first is to put your caption's HTML inside a hidden div on the page and reference that div by id in the caption option.
Like this:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a href="image1.jpg" <b>data-fb-options="caption:#myCaptionDiv"</b>&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
...
&lt;div id=&quot;myCaptionDiv&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color:#123456;&quot;&gt;
    Here's an HTML caption with &lt;a href=&quot;//example.com&quot;&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</div>
<p>
The second way is to assign the HTML caption directly in data-fb-options.
When assigned directly to the caption option all HTML entity characters (&amp; &quot; &lt; &gt;) will need to be encoded (&amp;amp; &amp;quot; &amp;lt; &amp;gt;) so that browsers can correctly parse the page.
This can get messy and can be harder to get right than the hidden div approach.
For example, the same caption assigned in the hidden div above looks like this when encoded and placed directly in the options:
</p>
<div class="code" style="white-space:normal">&lt;a href="image1.jpg" <b>data-fb-options="caption:`&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#123456;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Here's an HTML caption with &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;//example.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;a link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;`"</b>&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
(Told you it could get messy.)
<p>
If you set your caption to the string "href", the displayed caption will be the value of the anchor's href attribute.
This might be useful when displaying iframed content or if you want to display the path/filename of the current image.
</p><p>
Captions are normally assigned per-item in the data-fb-options attribute (or in fb.start's 'options' parameter).
They can, however, be set anywhere that options can be assigned and can apply globally, per page, per type, or per class.
Note that HTML placed directly into a caption defined in any of these locations does not need to be encoded.
Encoding is only for text in the HTML that is going to be parsed by the browser to render the page.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="headandfoot" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Header and Footer</p>
<p>
The header and footer areas are transparent divs immediately above and below the floatbox frame area.
These can be used to display content attached to, but outside of the box, such as alternate captions or any HTML.
One possible use is for branding of the floatbox display, or attaching a company logo.
See a footer in action in the  "lavish" example the "Options" tab of the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.
</p><p>
Header and footer can be assigned in exactly the same way as captions, described above - as direct text, encoded HTML, or a reference to a hidden div.
The names of the options to set are 'header' and 'footer'.
Pulling header and footer content from a hidden div is probably the most common and trouble-free approach.  Here's an example:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a href="somePage.html" <b>data-fb-options="header:#myHeaderDiv"</b>&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
<p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="outerclose" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Alternate Close button</p>
<p>
The traditional Floatbox close button is displayed in the frame, with or without text (see the 'showControlsText' option).
An alternate close button is available. It's not shown by default, but is used in some of the builtin className option sets.
This close button is a round disc with an 'X' in it and is displayed at the top right or top left corner of the floatbox.
</p><p>
To enable this 'outerClose' button, set showOuterClose to true.
Which corner it is displayed in is controlled by 'outerClosePos', which can be set to 'tr' or 'tl' and defaults to 'tr'.
If you wish to always use the outerClose button and not the traditional close button,
set both 'showClose:false' and 'showOuterClose:true' in the global section of fbOptions.js.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="classoptions" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Built-in class options</p>
<p>
Options assigned to class names are a great way to define a re-usable set of options for multiple floatboxed links.
There are five pre-defined className option sets defined in the fbOptions.js file which can be used to easily assign alternate appearance to a floatbox.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>modern</b> - Sets a crisp white and grey frame area with square corners and all controls and text along a top band.</li>
<li><b>alt</b> - Sets smaller-radius corners, uses the outerClose button, and sets different layout of the controls and captions.</li>
<li><b>transparent</b> - Good for presentation of transparent images.</li>
<li><b>naked</b> - Will show a plain image or other content with a close button and drop shadow, but no other decoration or floatbox frame area.</li>
<li><b>fbInfo</b> - Applies to secondary floatboxes opened from an Info... link (created with the 'info' option).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Use these pre-defined class options by assigning the class name to the floatboxed link they should apply to or to a containing element that has the floatbox class on it.
The class names can also be passed into an API fb.start call by assigning them to the 'className' option in fb.start's second options parameter.<br/>
E.g., <span class="code">&lt;a class="naked floatbox" href=...</span> or <span class="code">fb.start( 'somePage.html', 'className:modern' )</span>
</p><p>
Of course, the className options as presented in the fbOptions.js file can be tweaked and modified or used as the starting point for another set of options.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="info" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Info box for secondary content</p>
<p>
There are occasions when it is helpful to display additional information about your floatbox content.
For photogrpahs, this might be descriptive text, EXIF information or a popup location map.
Forms or other HTML content may have associated help or other information that can be effectively presented in a second floatbox.
Floatbox's info box capability addresses this usage.
When enabled, a link will appear in the lower left of the floatbox frame which activates the information box.
</p><p>
There are four options you can set in your anchor's data-fb-options attribute to enable and configure the info box.<br/>
1) Assign the url that points to the information source using the option "info". E.g.,
<span class="code">info:myInfoPage.html</span> or <span class="code">info:#myInfoDiv</span><br/>
2) Set floatbox options for the secondary info box using the option "infoOptions". E.g.,
<span class="code">infoOptions:`colorTheme:white width:400 height:300`</span>
(The backquotes are required to enable correct parsing.)<br/>
3) By default the link in the floatbox frame will display the text "Info..." or its localized language equivalent.
You can override this with the "infoText" option. E.g.,
<span class="code">infoText:`EXIF data...`</span><br/>
4) Use infoLinkPos to position the info link within floatbox border area. E.g.,
<span class="code">infoLinkPos:bl</span>
</p><p>
An anchor with an associated info box could look like this:
<div class="code">&lt;a href="myPhoto.jpg" class="floatbox"
data-fb-options="info:#myInfoDiv
infoOptions:`colorTheme:white width:400 height:300`" &gt;
  click here
&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
</p><p>
Yes, there's an example in the demo page's 'Options' section.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="print" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Print contents</p>
<p>
If you set "showPrint:true" in a floatboxed anchor's data-fb-options attribute, a "Print..." link will be shown in the floatbox border area.
When clicked, this link will invoke a second browser instance that will display just the contents of the floatbox window and will show the print dialog for this new browser instance.
The contents that will be printed will be just that from the floatbox display, not the surrounding eye candy and not the host page content.
Use the printLinkPos option to control where in the floatbox border the "Print..." link will appear.
Use the 'printText' option to change the displayed "Print..." link to any other desired text.
</p><p>
In some circumstances you may find that you want to add css styling to the print window contents.  You can do this with the printCSS option.
If printCSS is a URL path to a css file, that css file will be attached to the print window.
Or, you can just put css assignments directly into this option, surrounded by backquotes.
For example: <span class="code">data-fb-options="showPrint:true printCSS:/css/print.css"</span>
or <span class="code">data-fb-options="showPrint:true printCSS:`p {font-size: 11px;} etc...`"</span>
You often don't need to add any css stuff for printing, but it's there if you need it.
</p><p>
The print link will not appear for Mobile Safari devices (iphones etc.) because handheld devices don't have printers.<br/>
Also, printing is not available for iframe content that comes from a different domain than the base page (cross-site script blocking).
If you are displaying a cross-domain iframe in floatbox, the "Print..." option will not be displayed.
</p><p>
As usual, see the demo page ('Options' section) for an example.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="newwindow" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Open in a new window</p>
<p>
You may have occasion to offer your site visitors a way to open the current floatbox content into its own new window.
Do this by setting 'showNewWindow' to true in an anchor's option string (rev or data-fb-options attribute), or perhaps in className settings assigned to various items.
This will place a link in the floatbox frame that can be clicked to open the current content in a new window.
</p><p>
The string displayed in the new window link is localized in the language files and will be shown in the site visitor's native browser language.
The option 'closeOnNewWindow' (false by default) will cause the current floatbox to end when the new-window link is clicked.
</p>

<div id="indexlinks" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Index links in a gallery set</p>
<p>
Galleries of multiple images (or other content) can have a series of simple numbered links shown in the floatbox border area.
If there are thumbnails associated with linked images, these thumbnails will be displayed as small popups when the numbered link is hovered with the mouse.
</p><p>
Primary control over the display of index links is done with the numIndexLinks option.  If this is zero, index links will not be shown.
If it is -1, there is no limit on the number of index links shown - there will be a link for each image in the gallery group.
Any positive integer and the number of links shown will be limited to this amount (in case you don't want a huge list of numbered links for your gallery of 479 pictures).
</p><p>
Five other options affect index links.<br/>
Setting <b>showIndexThumbs</b> to false turns off the thumbnail popups within the index links.<br/>
You can use <b>maxIndexThumbSize</b> to scale down large thumbnail popups in the index links so that their largest side does not exceed the given given size.<br/>
A thumbnail image other than the thumbnail in the anchor on the main page can be used by setting <b>indexThumbSource</b> in an item's options, or indexThumbSource can be set to 'href' to use the host anchor's linked image.<br/>
And you can control the location of the index links with the <b>indexPos</b> option.
(See the "Layout" section of these instructions for details.)
</p><p>
You can see index links in action on the "Include Index Links" sample on the demo page.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="navigation" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Navigation and controls</p>
<p>
Floatbox includes controls for moving to previous and next items in a group, resizing, playing and pausing a slideshow, and exiting.
These controls consist of icon font graphics and may optionally include text labels localized to the user's language (see showControlsText in the Options Reference).
</p><p>
There are two sets of previous/next controls for grouped items.
"Overlay" navigation displays a small graphics on top of the displayed image when the mouse is over the left or right side of the image.
"Button" navigation displays a clickable <span class="code">&lt;&lt; prev || next &gt;&gt;</span> graphic, with or without text, in the box frame outside of the content.
You can specify use either or both of these by setting the navType option.
Most people will find that Floatbox makes pretty good choices about when to show which type of navigation, and that these settings don't normally need to be fiddled with.
</p><p>
When the floatbox content has been shrunk from its native size to fit the screen, or when it is displayed larger than the current screen size,
a resize control will be displayed which can be used to toggle the item's size.
The "resizeTool" option controls whether the resize control will be a custom maginfying-glass cursor or a small graphic in the top left corner.
If the custom cursor is used and overlay navigation is enabled, click-resizing is active only in the space between the two upper navigation areas.
(Opera always gets the graphic in the top left corner because it can't do custom cursors.)
</p><p>
When enableKeyboardNav is set to true, the following keys can be used in place of mouse-clicking the controls:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Close: <span class="code">Esc</span></li>
<li>Previous item in a group: <span class="code">left arrow</span></li>
<li>Next item in a group: <span class="code">right arrow</span></li>
<li>Toggle play and pause: <span class="code">spacebar</span></li>
<li>Resize item: <span class="code">Tab</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="layout" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Layout</p>
<p>
There are many things that can appear inside the floatbox frame area:
the two captions, an info link, print link, new-window link, item number for gallery sets, index links and the close button and navigation controls.
You can control the positioning of these items with the *pos options:
captionPos, caption2Pos, infoLinkPos, printLinkPos, newWindowLinkPos, itemNumberPos, indexPos and controlsPos.
</p><p>
The available positions are 'tl', 'tc', 'tr', 'bl', 'bc', and 'br' corresponding to top-left, top-center, bottom-left, etc.
You cannot fill all 6 positions. You can use only two positions at the top and two at the bottom.
So for example, if you have something assigned to the bottom-left, you can place something else either at bottom-center or bottom-right, but not both.
If you make a positioning request that cannot be filled, the frame items will be moved to other locations in the frame.
</p><p>
The close button and navigation controls cannot be assigned to a center position (tc or bc),
but you can set the centerNav option to true to move the navigation controls to the center of the frame while leaving the close button off to the side.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="appearance" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Appearance and Colors</p>
<p>
There's lots of control over Floatbox's appearance.
Many of Floatbox's options are for configuring appearance.
You can set the colors, round corners, border sizes, display of controls, shadow effect, transparencies and various animation effects through the configuration options.
See the <a href="options.html">options reference</a> for details on the use of these (and other) options.
</p><p>
Floatbox has 6 pre-configured color themes: white, black, blue, silver, red and yellow.
When no colorTheme option is specified, Floatbox defaults to black for images, white for HTML content, and blue for video and flash.
The 'colorTheme' option can be set globally, per page, or per item to override these per-type defaults.
</p><p>
Colors of various Floatbox components can be specified directly using color options.
In addition to colorTheme, the following are available:
boxColor, overlayColor, innerBorderColor, outerBorderColor, textColor, strongTextColor and contentBackgroundColor.
'strongTextColor' sets the caption color and the highlighted color of the other text items and controls when they are mouse-hovered.
'contentBackgroundColor' sets the background color inside the floatbox content area and is useful if the displayed content has transparent areas.
</p><p>
The floatbox frame area can be shown with a color gradient effect by assigning two css colors, separated by '|', to to the boxColor option.
For example: <span class="code">boxColor:#123456|#edca98</span>
</p><p>
Setting customized colors through options is best done by assigning the options to a className entry fbOptions and placing that class name on the floatboxed links.
See the Instruction sections on setting page-specific and site-wide options for details.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="background" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Custom background image</p>
<p>
You can use a graphic as an overlay background image by providing a background-image style for the overlay element.
In a css file, it would look something like this:
</p>
<div class="code">#fbOverlay {
    background-image: url(bkgrnd.gif);
}
</div>
<p>
The background-image setting can be placed in an external css file together with the appropriate include in the head section of your page,
or it can be placed directly inside a &lt;style&gt; element in the page head.
Of course, background-image can also be added to floatbox.css if you want it universally applied, but this will prove to be a pain when you upgrade to a new version.
</p><p>
When a custom background image is used, you may want to also set overlayOpacity to 100, or maybe play with lower values to fade the background.
For an example of a custom background and the use of autoStart and loadPageOnClose, check out the APOD slideshow on the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="language" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Language localization</p>
<p>
Floatbox includes language localization files for 40 languages.
The strings in these files are used as text labels on the various controls,
tooltiped keyboard hints on those controls,
the "image x of y" display, the text displayed on "Info..", "Print..." and showNewWindow links,
and the strings shown when a required multimedia plugin is not present.
The correct language file will be selected for use based on the localization settings of your site visitor's browser.
You may wish to set the Floatbox 'language' option to the language of your web site to keep Floatbox consistent with the site content.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="auto" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Auto-start and exit tasks</p>
<p>
You can have floatbox content appear directly on page load by using the autoStart option.
Put "autoStart:true" into the data-fb-options attribute of the floatbox-enabled item that you want to run automatically.
As soon as the page loads, floatbox will start with this item displayed.
You can use "autoStart:once" to have that tagged item display only on the first page load of the session.
Doing this sets a session cookie when the item is first shown and that item will not be auto-shown again as long as that session cookie is present.
</p><p>
You can also invoke an auto-start through a query string on the url used to invoke the page.
For example, a url of <span class="code">"//example.com/mypage.html?autoStart=myimage.jpg"</span>
will auto-start myimage.jpg provided there is an anchor on the page that is setup for floatbox and that has that image as its href value.
Note that the query string value only has to match the right-hand side of the anchor's href.
The given example would match an href of "/images/this_is_myimage.jpg".
</p><p>
Floatbox can automatically load or reload a web page in the browser when it exits.
The "loadPageOnClose" option is used to make this happen.
Set loadPageOnClose to the string 'self' to refresh the host page on exit.
This can be useful if your floatboxed content has modified some back-end content and the host page needs to be refreshed to reflect the changes.
If you set loadPageOnClose to the string 'back', the previous page in the browser's history list will be loaded.
This is used in the APOD slideshow on the demo page.
If loadPageOnClose is neither 'self' nor 'back', it is assumed to be a valid url and the browser will be instructed to load that page.
If you set loadPageOnClose to a url inside an option string, you will likely need to surround the url with backquotes (`) so as not to break parsing of the option string.
</p><p>
When closing floatbox by calling the API fb.end function, the equivalent to loadPageOnClose can be passed directly as an argument to that function like this:
<span class="code">fb.end( 'somePage.html' )</span>.
</p><p>
Be sure to see the API reference for information about the Floatbox callbacks that are available to run custom code on such events as floatbox or item start and end.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="imagemap" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Image map areas</p>
<p>
Floatbox can work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map">image map areas</a> the same way it does for standard &lt;a&gt; elements.
To do this, set up the class and options attributes as described above, but for image maps these attributes go on the map's &lt;area&gt; elements.
There's an example in the 'Images' section of the <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.
</p><p>
In addition to working with image maps on the main page, an image map can be assigned to an image shown in a floatbox.
The assigned map will scale with the image if it is resized for any reason.
See the 'useMap' entry in the Options Reference for info on how to set this up.
</p><p>
<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
</p>

<div id="dynamic" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Dynamically loading floatbox content via AJAX, script or UpdatePanel</p>
<p>
When floatbox first loads on a page, it runs its fb.activate function to inventory all the floatbox-enabled anchors and area maps on the page, and to add the required onclick action to those anchors.
It also activates any cycler sets, enhanced tooltips, context boxes, and popup thumbnails defined in the content.
If new content marked up for floatbox behaviour is dynamically added to a page after its initial load, fb.activate needs to be re-invoked to register that new content and assign the event handlers to the new elements.
</p><p>
Floatbox's built in fb.ajax() function will automatically run fb.activate against any new content brought in using that function.
However, you may be using a non-Floatbox AJAX content insertion something like this:
</p>
<div class="code">if (xhReq.readyState == 4) {
  document.getElementById('myXhrDiv').innerHTML = xhReq.responseText;
}
</div>
<p>
Light up the floatbox anchors in that dynamic content by adding the following line after that insertion:
</p>
<div class="code">if (xhReq.readyState == 4) {
  document.getElementById('myXhrDiv').innerHTML = xhReq.responseText;
  fb.activate();
}
</div>
<p>
This clears the existing inventory of anchors and then re-inventories the entire document, including the freshly added new content.
Now your new floatbox anchors will work.
</p><p>
A jQuery AJAX fetch which launches fb.activate on completion could look like this:
<div class="code">$.get('someURL.php', function(data) {
  $('#myXhrDiv').html(data);
  fb.activate();
});
</div>
<p>
The simplest AJAX approach is to use floatbox's built-in ajax function and get fb.activate executed for free.
</p>
<div class="code">fb.ajax({ source:'someURL.php', $:'myXhrDiv' });
</div>
<p>
For an ASP.NET UpdatePanel, you can set a callback function to fire the floatbox activation after the panel has finished updating.
Put this javascript on the page:
</p>
<div class="code">function pageLoad(sender, args) {
  if (args.get_isPartialLoad()) {
    fb.activate();
  }
}
</div>
<p>
Or... as an alternative to getting the fb.activate function to fire at the right time,
you could setup your new anchors with their own onclick action instead of giving them a class of "floatbox".
For example, the following anchor will fire up in floatbox when clicked without needing to be activated:
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;a href="somePage.html" onclick="fb.start(this); return false;"&gt;do it&lt;/a&gt;
</div>
<p>
You can add options to the above sample anchor in the usual way by adding the desired data-fb-options or rev attribute settings.

<div id="wordpress" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">WordPress and other templated systems</p>
<p>
Floatbox works the same on WordPress sites as it does on 'normal' web pages.
The .js and .css files go into a page's &lt;head&gt; section, and the 'floatbox' class goes on links inside the page.<br/>
The problem with editing the floatbox include lines directly into a theme's header.php file is that the changes may get trashed which each theme update.
This is where child themes come to the rescue. Add the floatbox bits to the head via a child-theme and they will persist.
If you're not familiar with this already, do some searching on "wordpress child themes", "wp_enqueue_script", "wp_enqueue_style" and other goodies.
</p><p>
As for editing a page's HTML, do that directly in the WordPress editor with the "Text (HTML)" view or tab of the editor.
Changes made here will persist through theme updates.
</p><p>
Other template systems are similar, and the tasks to get Floatbox going are the same everywhere:
get floatbox.js and floatbox.css on the page, and edit your HTML markup with the desired Floatbox bits.
And have fun...

<div id="actionscript" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Launching floatbox from flash ActionScript</p>
<p>
This topic has very little to do with Floatbox, and everything to do with authoring behaviours in Flash objects.
But there's a demand for this information so perhaps the little bit here can be some help.
</p><p>
Flash ActionScript can navigate to a URL on a click event, and a URL can be defined as a javascript action.
This allows us to launch Floatbox using its javascript fb.start() API function as the target of an ActionScript navigation URL.
Let's walk through setting that up.
</p><p>
Create a button in a flash object and give it a name. Let's call ours "button1".
Now define a click action on that button.
In ActionScript 2, that click action can be set on the button's action panel with <span class="code">on(release) { ... }</span>.
However, I think it's cleaner to define all ActionScript on the generic action panel of the layer object.
</p><p>
First, we'll get the click action to simply show a javascript alert.
On the layer's action panel, define an action like the following (this is ActionScript 2):
</p>
<div class="code">button1.onRelease = function() {
    getURL("javascript:alert(99)");
};

ActionScript 3 does not have a getURL function.  For AS3, use the more complex:
</p>
<div class="code">function myFunc(event:MouseEvent):void {
    var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest("javascript:alert(99)");
    navigateToURL(request, "_self");
}
button1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, myFunc);
</div>
<p>
The idea of using the simple alert is that we can test that the ActionScript is working first before involving Floatbox.
Assuming that it's working fine, let's replace the alert with the fb.start() call to open a floatbox.
Checking the <a href="api.html">API reference</a> we see that the fb.start function takes two string parameters.
The first is the path to the content to be shown and the second is any Floatbox options that we want to set for that content.
</p><p>
The AS2 code with the fb.start command will look something like this:
</p>
<div class="code">button1.onRelease = function() {
    getURL("javascript:fb.start('gumby.jpg', 'boxRoundCorners:none')");
};
</div>
<p>
And the equivalent AS3 code would be:
</p>
<div class="code">function myFunc(event:MouseEvent):void {
    var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest("javascript:fb.start('gumby.jpg', 'boxRoundCorners:none')");
    navigateToURL(request, "_self");
}
button1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, myFunc);
</div>
<p>
I've used an arbitrary option here just to show where the options go.
The options parameter is optional (no pun intended), and the simple <span class="code">fb.start('gumby.jpg')</span> is perfectly legal.
</p><p>
That's it.
Providing you've got the Floatbox files properly included on the page
and the content reference in the fb.start command points to something that exists,
you should have Floatbox opening from a click on a flash button.
If it's not working, confirm that the simple alert(99) works from the click action.
If it does, then try pasting and running the javascript action directly into a browser's address bar and running it from there.
If <span class="code">javascript:fb.start('pathToYourContent')</span> doesn't work from the address bar, you need to look for the reason why.

There's a couple of samples in the 'Hi-Tech' section of the Floatbox <a href="http://floatboxjs.com/demo">demo page</a>.

<div id="gzip" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Serving gzip compressed files on Apache and IIS</p>
<p>
Warning: This section discusses modifying your .htaccess file and using mod_rewrite on your Apache server.
This is a bit of a black art.  What works on one server configuration may not work another.
No support or assistance is provided for modifying your .htaccess file or for serving the gzip files.
</p><p>
There is a 'gzip' folder in the Floatbox distribution zip file that contains gzipped version
of Floatbox's js and css files. If you want to use them, copy them down into the main floatbox folder
and configure your server to use them.
The gzip files are a fraction of the size of the original files, but serve exactly the same content to the browser.
You can direct your Apache server to serve these gzip files through your .htaccess file.
The .htaccess file can be located in the floatbox or modules folder itself if you only want to serve floatbox gzipped files.
If you want to enable gzipped files across your site, the .htaccess directives can go in your site's root folder.
</p><p>
Here's the suggested (but unsupported) htaccess directives to enable gzip file serving.
</p>
<div class="code">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;

Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine on
# if folder aliases are in use, set the correct RewriteBase for this folder
# RewriteBase /

&lt;FilesMatch "\.js\.gz$"&gt;
    ForceType text/javascript
    Header set Content-Encoding: gzip
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

&lt;FilesMatch "\.css\.gz$"&gt;
    ForceType text/css
    Header set Content-Encoding: gzip
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

&lt;FilesMatch "\.html\.gz$"&gt;
    ForceType text/html
    Header set Content-Encoding: gzip
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.gz -f
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ $1.gz [L]

&lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</div>
<p>
Options.js is not provided in gzip format because it is intended to be edited with your implementation preferences.
If you want to serve a gzipped version of this file, first edit (or use the configurator) to set your option preferences and then gzip the modified file.

</p><p>
IIS does not use the gzip files that are provided in the Floatbox package.
Instead, compression is enabled and configured within IIS and IIS will generate its own compressed version of the served files.
A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gzip+iis">search on "gzip iis"</a> will locate information on how to enable and configure compression in IIS.

<div id="library" class="section_break"></div>
<p class="section_title">Using the library functions</p>
<p>
Floatbox exposes an API to many of its internal functions that allows it be used as an effective javascript library in contexts beyond the base Floatbox functionality.
In many cases, you can avoid loading other libraries such as jquery or mootools and instead use the Floatbox calls that are already loaded on your page.
The Floatbox library includes a simple to use, robust and flexible AJAX utility, language translation,
event handling, an image preloader, easy flash object creation, some helpful DOM manipulation routines, and more.
For a complete list of available Floatbox functions, please see the <a href="api.html">API reference</a>.
